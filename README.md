# Simple Virtual Keyboard
_________________________

I have made this keyboard as more of a fun project and to explore other experiences with Java. 
I will say the keyboard sprites/style are not mine I have used this keyboard from here:

How this keyboard works is pretty much just like a keyboard but, only on the computer. So, the user can use their mouse and click on the corresponding key and it will print out the letter on a certain text field like search bars, messages, notepad, etc. Also, it is much simpler compared to an actual 
keyboard as I was working with a pre-existing sprite. 

The functions of the keyboard are:
- Standard key presses such as being able to enter in letters or numbers or certain special characters.
- Caps lock for enabling capital letters.
- Backspace.
- Enter/return.
- A space button.
